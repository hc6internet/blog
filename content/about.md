I am a software engineer with keen interest in building scalable and reliable services. 

While trying to understand how various Internet technologies work, I realize that the best way to learn about something, is to actually try to build it. So I decided to undertake the following experiment:

    To build all modern Internet services within an year.

This blog is meant to share my experiences and lessons from this experiment. I will document my thinking processes and any code that I produced during this process. However, this is not a tutorial. Any code produced here works
in a simulated environment, but never tested (or meant to be used) in production.

The designs and architectures are based on my understanding and research. I do not work for the organizations that produce these services, or use any of the code from the organization that I work for. There are undoubtedly many mistakes, and definitely a lot of rooms for improvement in my designs. Please feel free to correct me or discuss with me, either on the comments section or via [email](mailto:hc6internet@gmail.com). I will be more than happy to learn from you.

Otherwise, enjoy my blog.
